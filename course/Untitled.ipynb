    "The University Class Scheduling Problem (UCSP) represents an important class of optimization problems in operational research. It is considered one of the most difficult problems faced by universities and colleges today. Briefly defined, given a number of courses and classrooms, the goal is to assign courses to classrooms while satisfying all of the university constraints and optimizing the utilization of existing facilities effectively and efficiently.\n",

    "大学课程调度问题（UCSP）是运营研究中一个重要的优化问题。 它被认为是今天大学和学院面临的最困难的问题之一。 简单来说，给定一定数量的课程和教室，目标是在课堂上设置课程，同时满足所有的大学制约，有效地优化现有设施的利用。\n",

    "Given the increasing number of students in universities, a large number of courses are offered every term. Each course has a different number of enrolled students and each classroom has different capacities which make the assignment of courses to classrooms complicated. Furthermore, it is not only enough to schedule a course in a classroom with a higher capacity than the number of enrolled students, since this can still lead to inefficient utilization of classrooms which can upset instructors and students. For-example, given two courses with 6 and 19 enrolled students, respectively, and two classrooms with capacities of 20 and 50 students, respectively, both courses can fit in either of the classrooms. However, it would make more sense to assign the larger course to the larger classroom which will improve the student’s learning experience, allow additional students to attend the class, and reduce the chances of cheating when conducting exams. \n",

    "由于大学生人数不断增加，每学期都会提供大量课程。 每个课程有不同的入学学生人数，每个教室都有不同的能力，使得课程的分配变得更加复杂。 此外，在课堂上安排课程比在招生人数更高的课程不仅足够，因为这仍然会导致教室效率低下，导致教师和学生不高兴。 例如，分两个课程，分别有6个和19个入学学生，两个能力分别为20和50个的教室，这两个课程可以适用于任何一个教室。 然而，将更大的课程分配给更大的课堂，这将提高学生的学习经验，允许其他学生上课，并减少在考试时作弊的机会。\n",

    "Many formulations and algorithms have been proposed to solve UCSP. Most of these algorithms are based on local search techniques, namely hill climbing, simulated annealing, and tabu search [7] [11] [14] [19]. Such algorithms cannot prove unsatisfiability or guarantee that a solution is optimal. In other words, if a solution is found, it cannot guarantee that this solution has the best possible optimization cost. In this paper, we propose an integer linear programming (ILP) approach to solve the UCSP. The approach is complete and hence examines the entire search space defined by the problem to prove that either (i) the problem has no solution, i.e. the problem is unsatisfiable, or (ii) that a solution does exist, i.e. the problem is satisfiable. If the problem is satisfiable, the proposed approach will search all possible solutions to find the optimal solution. \n",

    "Recently, advanced Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) solvers have been extended to solve 0-1 ILP problems  [1]. The SAT problem is a central problem in artificial intelligence and computer science and has received considerable attention from researchers. Many complex Engineering problems have been successfully solved using SAT. Such problems include routing [16], power optimization [2], verification [4], and graph coloring  [17], etc. Today, several powerful SAT solvers exist and are able of handling problems consisting of thousands of variables and millions of constraints [10] [13] [15]. They can also compete with the best available generic ILP solvers. \n",

    "In this paper, we will show how to formulate the UCSP as an ILP problem and study the possibility of solving the UCSP using (i) advanced SAT-based 0-1 ILP algorithms and (ii) generic-based ILP algorithms. We compare the performance of both algorithms and provide empirical results showing that generic-based ILP solvers tend to outperform SAT-based ILP solvers for the proposed problem. The results include the actual schedule of classrooms and courses offered in the School of Engineering at the American University of Sharjah in addition to randomly generated set of courses and classrooms. The proposed approach is complete and is guaranteed to identify the optimal schedule. \n",

    "In this paper, we are interested in evaluating the use of advanced ILP solvers, SAT- and generic-based, in solving the university class scheduling problem (UCSP). We start by describing how to formulate the problem as 0-1 ILP. To illustrate our approach, consider a university with n courses and m classrooms. In general, the number of classrooms m is greater than or equal to the number of courses n. For each course i, we define m variables as follows: \n",
