    "`node-gyp`是一个跨平台的命令行工具，用`Node.js`编写用于编译`Node.js`的原生插件模块。 它捆绑了Chromium团队使用的 [gyp](https://gyp.gsrc.io/) 项目，消除了处理构建平台各种差异的痛苦。 它是对于节点`v0.8`删除的`node-waf`程序的替代。 如果您有一个仍然有`wscript`文件的节点的本机插件，那么您应该肯定添加一个`binding.gyp`文件来支持最新版本的节点。\n",

    "  * make\n",
    "  * A proper C/C++ compiler toolchain, like GCC\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mac OS X:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * python (v2.7 recommended, v3.x.x is not supported) (already installed on Mac OS X)\n",
    "  * Xcode\n",
    "    * You also need to install the Command Line Tools via Xcode. You can find this under the menu Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads\n",
    "    * This step will install gcc and the related toolchain containing make\n",
    "\n",
    "* Windows:\n",

    "  * Option 1: Install all the required tools and configurations using Microsoft's windows-build-tools using `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools` from an elevated PowerShell or CMD.exe (run as Administrator).\n",

    "      * Option 1: Install Visual C++ Build Tools using the Default Install option.\n",
    "\n",
    "      * Option 2: Install Visual Studio 2015 (or modify an existing installation) and select Common Tools for Visual C++ during setup. This also works with the free Community and Express for Desktop editions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * [Windows Vista / 7 only] requires .NET Framework 4.5.1\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Install Python 2.7 (v3.x.x is not supported), and run npm config set python python2.7 (or see below for further instructions on specifying the proper Python version and path.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Launch cmd, npm config set msvs_version 2015\n",

    "If you have multiple Python versions installed, you can identify which Python version node-gyp uses by setting the '--python' variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "node-gyp --python /path/to/python2.7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If node-gyp is called by way of npm and you have multiple versions of Python installed, then you can set npm's 'python' config key to the appropriate value:\n",

    "```bash\n",
    "npm config set python /path/to/executable/python2.7\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that OS X is just a flavour of Unix and so needs python, make, and C/C++. An easy way to obtain these is to install XCode from Apple, and then use it to install the command line tools (under Preferences -> Downloads)."
